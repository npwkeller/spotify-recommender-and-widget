# spotify-recommender-and-widget
Taking a spotify dataset from Kaggle and looking to create a recommender system and interactive widget.

The dataset on kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maharshipandya/-spotify-tracks-dataset

Here, I am creating my first recommender system. Specifically, a content based recommender system using cosine similiarity and some feature engineering to find similar songs based on an inputted song in Python.

The model seems to give us good predictions of similar songs but is a little difficult to use so I am currently working on creating a search engine widget.
